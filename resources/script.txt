Rocky is the sweetest little angel. At the shelter, he didn’t bark even once. Just smiled at me.

Driving home, I texted my husband, “On OUR way home. Not sold on the name Rocky. I was thinking Sargent Bark.”

“Babe.”

“What?”

“For the name. ‘Babe.’ Because he’s a pig. Get it?”

I entered our home ready to scold my husband for suggesting such a mean name. But he wasn’t home.

“Where are you?” I messaged him.

“Work. Almost done.”

“I thought the office was closed on Sundays?”

“Catching up on paperwork. Will be home soon.”

Another reason I wanted a dog. My husband has been working all the time lately. Odd hours. Sometimes late at night.

I gave Rocky a tour of our home. I showed him his kennel, and the toys I bought him. I could see the happiness in his eyes.

When my husband got home I excitedly brought our new dog to show him.

Rocky became agitated. He barked loudly at my husband, and tried to dig his paws into my husband's legs.

I restrained Rocky. “He’s never acted like this, I swear.”

“Honey, I just went to the dispensary. There’s weed in my pocket.”
