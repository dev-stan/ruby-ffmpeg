I'm in Tech Support, and a user calls, saying they need help on the computer. For this user, it would be easier to just see their screen than try to decrypt their code. I ask for the computer name, which is printed on a white label on the laptop lid.  
They hesitate.  
I remind them where the label is.  
They say they don't know.  
I remind them where the label is.  
They ask if I can find out from my end.  
I remind them how it's one second to close the lid a bit, it'd be a minute to look it up, and where the label is.  
They request that I find out from my end.  
I look up their computer, find the name, and ask if the computer name is correct.  
They say yes.  
I ask if that's the name on the label.  
They say yes.  
I wanted to ask why they felt like wasting my time that can never come back but I just try to fix the issue ASAP so I can hang up.  
Unprompted, they say that they didn't know if they were supposed to say the name.  
I guess somehow they didn't trust the number they called, the company Tech Support line.  
I'd love to see quantum computing take a crack at decrypting whatever goes on in their brain cell into anything resembling rational thought.  
I guess next time I'll just say I'll call them back once I figure out the computer name.
